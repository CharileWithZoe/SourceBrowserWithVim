# SourceBrowserWithVim
Use VIM to browser source codes in Windows

As the source insight is not allowed to use in the office, a new way of browsing code is very urgent.

This project begines at 2018/09/04, I want to keep track of how long it takes to finish the project, and of course I have to keep track of whether I have finished it or not.

God bless me!
